      Mama mia so you actually bought your flight to Italy.  Tryig to get that good pasta and Spaghetti. If you want
      to go to a Romantic Spot definitely check out Venice.  It is the city surrounded by Water and you can even ride a gondala
      with your romantic partnet. There is so much art history here that you would have to pack it into several weeks.
