      So you finally decided to get off your bum and start traveling the world.  That is fantastic! Now I'm here to tell you why you should be visiting one of Asia's most
      prominent countries Japan.  Not only does it havea rich culture and one of the tech capitals of the world but it is also welcoming to foreigners.  When traveling there you can
      decide if you would like to visit more of a city center like Tokyo or maybe change it up and go to the countryside to see some shrines like in Kyoto.  No matter what you do it
      would be in your best interest to investin a JR PASS so you can freely move around on the trains.  You can only do this by submitting your form within 90 days of your trip so don't fret.
