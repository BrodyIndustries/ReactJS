      Belgium is home of the French Fry and good beer.  If you ever want to have an amazing experience go to Delerium Bar in Brussels.
      There are over 1000+ beers on tap and the bartenders are required to speak 3 different languages.  The scenery is beautiful and you will also have to take place in all of the festivities.
